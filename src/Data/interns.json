It required understanding the exact API structure and managing token-based authentication, which often failed due to expiration or incorrect scopes. Another tough moment was integrating AEM Assets for document uploads \u2014 handling file size limits, metadata, and ensuring secure service credentials took several trials.\n\nA big breakthrough came when the entire request form flow\u2014from fetching request types to submitting user input\u2014was successfully connected with Workfront\u2019s backend.

The goal was to compare traditional development with EDS: how the approach differs, how easy or difficult it is to build and maintain, and how it impacts the **Lighthouse score** and overall site speed.\n\nGetting started with EDS wasn\u2019t easy. It was a completely new way of working \u2014 using blocks, authoring content through Google Docs, and previewing through Sidekick took some getting used to. On top of that, making sure the site stayed fast and optimizing the Lighthouse score added to the initial challenge. But after a few days of exploring, trying things out, and making mistakes, I began to understand how it all fits together.\n\nOnce I got the hang of it, building the site became smoother and more intuitive. I could see the benefits of modular development, faster load times, and how clearly content and code were separated. This experience helped me learn a more scalable, efficient way of developing websites and gave me a solid comparison to the traditional approach.\n",
    "about_adobe": "When I joined on the very first day, stepping into the corporate world was a completely new experience for me.

Over the course of my journey, I met a lot of wonderful people, made new friends, and connected with mentors who guided me patiently. I learned not just about work, but also about collaboration, communication, and what it means to grow in a professional environment. Along the way, I created valuable memories filled with learning, laughter, and joy. One personal milestone was going to the gym for the first time in my life ,right here at Adobe, with friends who made the experience both fun and motivating.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the various events and activities that happened during my time here. I had the opportunity to participate in the cricket tournament, where we made it to the semi-finals \u2014 a proud moment for me was defending 7 runs in the last over of the quarter-finals, something I\u2019ll always cherish. At the community fair, I stacked 19 shuttlecocks on top of each other and came second in the cycling club\u2019s challenge ,small wins, but full of excitement and fun. The Alchemy event was also a special highlight. The food, too, was something I looked forward to .\n\nBeyond these experiences, I also had the chance to dive deep into the world of UI development. I learned the foundational principles of user interface design, how developers think about structure, accessibility, and performance. My journey into Edge Delivery Services (EDS) helped me understand modern web architecture and how it compares with conventional approaches. I explored concepts like modular blocks, Google Docs-based authoring, and Sidekick previews, which opened my eyes to how scalable and efficient content delivery can be. I also learned how to analyze and improve Lighthouse scores, and why these metrics \u2014 like performance, accessibility, and SEO \u2014 are critical for real-world web experiences. This technical exposure helped me bridge the gap between design and development and strengthened my confidence as a budding frontend developer.",

One of the tricky bugs involved ensuring accurate filtering from SharePoint lists, especially with varied date entries and choice fields.

I also integrated Power Automate to enable one-click Excel report downloads, pulling structured data from SharePoint and saving it to OneDrive in a clean, ready-to-share format. There were definitely brain-fry moments, especially while dealing with delegation warnings and aligning Power Apps logic with Power Automate flows. But in the end, the solution delivered measurable efficiency, better visibility for managers, and an overall smoother attendance process.",

By integrating Generative AI capabilities, Omnis AI empowers users to work more efficiently and achieve their goals with enhanced precision and speed.\n\nDuring development, one of the biggest challenges was implementing secure and scalable multi-organization support. We used AWS Cognito with custom attributes (custom:orgs) to associate users with multiple organizations and built a dynamic organization dropdown in the UI to reflect this. Connecting the frontend (React) with the backend (AWS Lambda via API Gateway) led to multiple CORS-related issues, requiring careful debugging of headers and preflight configurations.\n\nAnother complex task was syncing user authentication, signup, and org registration flows, all while maintaining a clean and responsive UI. There were several \"brain-fry\" moments\u2014like debugging broken axios calls and handling nested attribute updates in Cognito\u2014but each breakthrough taught us more about cloud architecture, security, and UI/backend synchronization.

One of the biggest challenges was extracting recipes from AI through APIs based on user information ; early on, the model either overgeneralized or got too rigid. We spent a lot of time refining the prompt parsing logic and setting up a flow that balanced personalization with practicality. There were moments when nothing worked as expected\u2014calorie mismatches, buggy ingredient substitutions, or meals with wildly off nutrition stats\u2014but each bug pushed us closer to understanding how to make the system more reliable. The breakthrough came when we integrated a feedback loop allowing the system to learn and adjust based on user inputs. It turned NutriAI from just another diet app into a more intuitive companion.

The CSIRT alert cited a command-line request to a Cloudflare Tunnel endpoint and reminded me (in very official language!) that such tunnelling services were against Adobe’s security policy. Once the moment of panic passed, I drafted a response explaining my purpose for using Cloudflared, and fervently hoped that this wouldn't affect my manager's impression of me. This incident taught me the importance of secure practices in enterprise environments… and that even a simple curl can trigger a serious chain of events!",

    "about_project": "During my internship, I built a conversational AI assistant to streamline Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) schema creation. The assistant interprets natural language to identify the correct XDM class, field groups (both standard and custom), identity fields, and then generates valid AEP schema payloads\u2014automagically. I worked extensively with LangChain, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), function calling, and tool-based agents to orchestrate multi-step logic and dynamic tool selection. The backend was developed in Python, and I integrated Adobe\u2019s Schema Registry API to fetch and manipulate real schema components using GET, PATCH, and POST calls. Bugs? Oh, there were plenty. From infinite recursive tool calls (because the agent developed short-term memory loss) to complex field group merging logic that refused to cooperate, the debugging sessions were intense. But breakthroughs like modularizing the payload generator, validating schema JSONs, adding PATCH support, and dynamically suggesting field groups made it all worth it. I also used Requests, Pydantic, and thread-safe caching to optimize response time and data integrity. Overall, the project pushed me deep into conversational UX, platform integration, and API-first thinking\u2014and taught me how to keep my cool when Adobe spits out a 400.",
    "about_adobe": "This internship was insane in the best way possible. I got to explore bleeding-edge agentic tools like LangChain, the latest OpenAI APIs, AWS lambda functions and Adobe AEP... and also discovered that bugs multiply when you stare at them. I loved the creative freedom, the mentorship, and that magical moment when the chatbot finally stopped hallucinating and started actually building usable schemas. My most unforgettable moment? When my code worked perfectly during a live demo even though it hadn\u2019t all morning\u2014and I had to pretend that was totally planned. I also may have committed files to the wrong branch more times than I\u2019d like to admit. But hey, version control is character-building, right? Between late-night debugging marathons, team banter, and that sweet dopamine rush of pushing clean code, this internship gave me skills, confidence, and a whole new level of appreciation for well-documented APIs.",
